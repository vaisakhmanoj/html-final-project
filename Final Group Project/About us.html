                <h1>About us</h1>
                <p>The first Sony Walkman, the TPS-L2, was introduced in July 1979. 
                    It was a portable cassette player that allowed people to listen
                    to music on the go. The device was designed by Sony co-founded
                     Masaru Ibuka and was initially met with skepticism, but it quickly 
                     gained popularity. The Walkman had a significant impact on the 
                     music industry and how people consumed music. It provided a more 
                     personalized and portable way to listen to music compared to 
                     traditional home-based audio systems.</p>
                
                <!-- Our History section -->
                <h1>Our History</h1>
                <p>Sony was founded on May 7, 1946, by Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita. 
                    The company started as an electronics shop called Tokyo Tsushin
                     Kogyo (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation). Its 
                     initial focus was on repairing electronic equipment and developing 
                     new products. In 1958, the company officially changed its name 
                     to Sony Corporation. The name "Sony" is a combination of two 
                     words: "sonus," the Latin word for sound, and "sonny," a colloquial 
                     term used in the 1950s to refer to a young boy. Sony introduced
                     its first tape recorder, the G-Type recorder, in 1950. This marked
                     the beginning of Sony's involvement in the recording and playback 
                     industry.One of Sony's most iconic products, the Walkman, was
                      introduced in 1979. It transformed the way people listened to music 
                      by providing a portable and personal audio experience.</p>

                <h3>Expanding across the world</h3>
                <p>Sony expanded its business into the entertainment industry by acquiring 
                   Columbia Pictures in 1989 and CBS Records in 1988. The company established
                   itself as a major player in the global entertainment market.</p>
